<center><h1>P-Hacking</h1></center>
					
<hr/>

<p>It turns out that science has a bug! If you test many hypotheses but only report the one with the lowest p-value you are more likely to get a spurious result (one resulting from chance, not a real pattern). 

<p>Recall p-values: A p-value was meant to represent the probability of a spurious result. It is the chance of seeing a difference in means (or in whichever statistic you are measuring) at least as large as the one observed in the dataset if the two populations were actually identical. A p-value < 0.05 is considered "statistically significant". In class we compared sample means of two populations and calculated p-values. What if we had 5 populations and searched for pairs with a significant p-value? This is called p-hacking!

<p>To explore this idea, we are going to look for patterns in a dataset which is totally random – every value is Uniform(0,1) and independent of every other value. There is clearly no significance in any difference in means in this toy dataset. However, we might find a result which looks statistically significant just by chance. Here is an example of a simulated dataset with 5 random populations, each of which has 20 samples:

    </p>

<p>The numbers in the table above are just for demonstration purposes. You should not base your answer off of them. We call each population a random population to emphasize that there is no pattern.


<h3>There are Many comparisons</h3>

<p>How many ways can you choose a pair of two populations from a set of five to compare? The values of elements within the population do not matter nor does the order of the pair.

<h3>Understanding the mean of IID Uniforms</h3>
<p>What is the variance of a Uniform(0, 1)?
    <div class="bordered">
        Let $Z \sim \Uni(0, 1)$
\begin{align*}
\Var(Z) 
&= \frac{1}{12}(\beta - \alpha) \\
&=\frac{1}{12} (1-0)\\
&= \frac{1}{12}
\end{align*}
</div></p>



<p>What is an approximation for the distribution of the mean of 20 samples from Uniform(0,1)?
    
<div class="bordered">
Let $Z_1...Z_n$ be i.i.d. $\Uni(0,1)$. Let $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_i$.

\[\E[X] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[Z_i] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} 0.5 = \frac{n}{n} 0.5 = 0.5\]

\begin{align*}
\Var(X) 
&= \Var\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_i\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{n^2} \Var\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_i\right)\\
&= \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Var\left(Z_i\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v \\
&= \frac{n}{n^2} v = \frac{v}{n} = \frac{v}{20} = \frac{1}{240}
\end{align*}

Using CLT, $\bar{X}\sim N\left(\mu = 0.5 , \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{240}\right)$
</div>

<p>What is an approximation for the distribution of the mean from one population minus the mean from another population? Note: this value may be negative if the first population has a smaller mean than the second.
    
<div class="bordered">
Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the means of the populations. <br/>$X_1\sim N(\mu = 0.5 , \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{240})$<br/> $X_2\sim N(\mu = 0.5 , \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{240})$

The expectation is simple to calculate because 
$$E[X_1 - X_2] = E[X_1] - E[X_2] = 0$$

\begin{align*}
\Var(X_1 - X_2) &= \Var(X_1) + \Var(X_2) \\
&= \frac{1}{120}
\end{align*}
The sum (or difference) of independent normals is still normal: \fbox{$Y \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = \frac{v}{10})$}

</div>

\item (8 points) What is the smallest difference in means, $k$, that would look statistically significant if there were only two populations? In other words, the probability of seeing a difference in means of $k$ or greater is < 0.05. 

\iftoggle{soln}
{
\begin{shaded}
One tricky part of this problem is to recognize the double sidedness to distance. We would consider it a significant distance if $P(Y<-k)$ or $P(Y > k)$.
\begin{align*}
    P(Y < -k) + P(Y > k) &= 0.05  \\
F_Y(-k) + (1 - F_Y(k)) &= 0.05 \\
(1-F_Y(k)) + (1 - F_Y(k)) &= 0.05 \\
2 - 2F_Y(k) &= 0.05 \\
F_Y(k) &= 0.975
\end{align*}

Now we need the inverse $\Phi$ to get the value of $k$ out.
\begin{align*}
    0.975 &= \Phi\Big(\frac{k - 0}{\sqrt{v/10}}\Big) \\
    \Phi^{-1}(0.975) &= \frac{k}{\sqrt{v/10}} \\
    k &= \Phi^{-1}(0.975)\sqrt{v/10}
\end{align*}

\item (5 points) Give an expression for the probability that the smallest sample mean among 5 random populations is less than 0.2.

\iftoggle{soln}
{
\begin{shaded}

Let $X_i$ be the sample mean of population $i$.

\begin{align*}
    P(min\{X_1 ... X_n\} < 0.2) 
    &= P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{5} X_i < 0.2\right) \\
    &= 1 - P\left(\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{5} X_i < 0.2\right)^{\complement}\right) \\
    &= 1 - P\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^{5} X_i \geq 0.2\right) \\
    &= 1 - \prod_{i=1}^5 P(X_i \ge 0.2) \\
    &= 1 - \prod_{i=1}^5 1 - \Phi\Big(\frac{0.2 - 0.5}{\sqrt{v/20}}\Big) \\
\end{align*}

\end{shaded}

\item (7 points) Use the following functions to write code that estimates the probability that among 5 populations you find a difference of means which would be considered significant (using the bootstrapping method designed to compare 2 populations). Run at least 10,000 simulations to estimate your answer. You may use the following helper functions. Write pseudocode:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# the smallest difference in means that would look statistically significant
k = calculate_k()

# create a matrix with n_rows by n_cols elements, each of which is Uni(0, 1)
matrix = random_matrix(n_rows, n_cols)

# from the matrix, return the column (as a list) which has the smallest mean
min_mean_col = get_min_mean_col(matrix)

# from the matrix, return the row (as a list) which has the largest mean
max_mean_col = get_max_mean_col(matrix)

# calculate the p-value between two lists using bootstrapping (like in pset5)
p_value = bootstrap(list1, list2)



\end{lstlisting}
